//! # Rust Bibtcoin Numeric Library
//!
//! This is a simple, no-dependency library which implements utility functions
//! for working with big integers, hex encodings etc needed by Bitcoin. It
//! differs from other existing cragtes in the field in it's focus on
//! supporting the same versions of Rust compilers as `bitcoin` and
//! `bitcoin_hashes` crates and not using any external dependencies in order
//! to reduce potential attack surface.

// In general, rust is absolutely horrid at supporting users doing things like,
// for example, compiling Rust code for real environments. Disable useless lints
// that don't do anything but annoy us and cant actually ever be resolved.
